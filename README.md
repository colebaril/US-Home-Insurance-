This visualization, created using R and ggplot2, showcases the relationship between natural disasters and home insurance premiums across the U.S. The hurricane and tornado data were sourced from NOAA, while the home insurance data came from Bankrate. Although insurance premiums are influenced by many factors such as local regulations, construction costs, and individual home characteristics, a clear trend emerges: states with a higher frequency of destructive storms, such as Florida, tend to have significantly higher home insurance premiums. This highlights the increasing financial impact of natural disasters on homeowners.
